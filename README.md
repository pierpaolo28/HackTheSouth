# Hack the South - Best Hardware Design Prize Winner
University of Southampton - HackTheSouth - Hackaton Code <br>

This project consists of designing and building a voice-activated autonomous robot. The intuitiveness of our robot makes it ideal for 
general public use. The tasks it can accomplish bring great value to its users and particularly for assisting impaired people. <br>

The demonstration my group provided during this hackathon consisted of locating a drink and serving it to its user. However, the robot 
is not limited to this task and has the potential to empower the population with its wide variety of applications. <br>

The robot harnesses a multitude of different technologies such as voice-assistive technology using Google cloudâ€™s Google Assistant API 
or the machine learning techniques that allow it to detect various object and faces. <br>

The program for the robot is executed on a raspberry pi coupled with an Arduino to allow a low consumption of power. The efficiency of 
our robot results in low cost and small environmental impact. <br>

The raspberry-pi is used to perfect the voice recognition of the system as well as the field vision. The Arduino board is used to power 
the servo motors and serial communications. Although the main chassis of the robot was built using the inventor fit for RedBot, 3D 
printed parts were tailored for the task specifications. <br>
